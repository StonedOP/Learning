git remote add origin <URL> ->
here remote describes that we are working with URLS
origin is the name given to the URL
NOW until this point we have set up a connection with repository
git push origin master -> it pushes new commits to the master branch
master represents the branch that we are adding to
git remote -v ->to check repository 
head represents on which branch you r working on
origin/master in different color will represent the commit address that is updated or being desplayed on the repository

to make changes in projects on gitHUB we to fork or clone them
git clone<URL> -> to do so we need the url of that project
after cloning we can check by changing the directory<cd> and using cat<fileName>

an upstream URL is the URL from where you have colned an project
to add it 
git remote upstream <URL>


git branch <name> -> to create a new branch
git checkout <name> ->used to transfer the control to <name> branch

also u can not push your own branch to <upstream> coz u it is someone's main project we r working on and we dont have access to it so we can not directly update it
i.e. we can't do git push upstream <branch> 
we can do 
git push origin <branch> -> coz we have access to it


now i will be removing newfileDEL1 bye using branch somethingDEL1
and when we have to remove a file that is present in ONLINErepository but not in my repository then
git push origin <branch> -f we have force push the push request
