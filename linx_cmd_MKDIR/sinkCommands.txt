when changes are in upstream main branch get updated
but the origin main or master branch doesnot get updated
to update it from gitHUB u can use fetch upstream button


also if the change r made in the project's main branch then 
we want those update to be in our forked project main branch too 

to do it manually 
we have to go back to main branch by checkout <branch>
and then we can check by <git log> how much we lag from upstream branch

git fetch --all --prune ->
here prune means changes thet were deleted will also be brought
then we reset the main branch of <origin> to the main branch of <upstream>/main branch
we do the above by 
git reset --hard upstream/main

after that we check if its in sink by <git log> to check if the commits in local foldermatches with the upstream

also we have to push them to online repository
git push origin main ->

we can also update our origin by 1 command 
git pull upstream main ->
pull does the same thing the fetch did internally and update the local folder

to make changes in repository we again do
git push origin main ->

so when we want to get the updates to our origin somebody else merged to upstream we use p
