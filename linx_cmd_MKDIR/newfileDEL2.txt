this is the second file 
i will try to delete these files 
also i want be commiting any changes 
else putting these changes in stash

after learnig about repository 
i have learnt how to push files to the repository 
now its time to learn about branches

i have created a new branch newlearning 
i know why we need to create new branches coz we can no tadd the code the we edited to the original repository
so we create our own branch and make changes in it 
and after completing we push our <origin><branch> to the upstream URL that we have to update when we r working on someones project and we have to push our code 
so after uploding we make a pull request to the host
